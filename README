hg-fastimport - a tool for importing "git-fast-import" files into Mercurial

WARNING: this tool is very incomplete and barely tested.  It is
currently intended for active developers only.

hg-fastimport is (or will be) a tool which converts "git-fast-import"
files into Mercurial repositories.  "git-fast-import" is a file format
for representing the entire history of a version control repository.

http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git-core/docs/git-fast-import.html

This file format was designed to make it easier to write tools which
converted from foreign VCS repository formats into "git" format; such
tools exist for CVS, Mercurial, Darcs, and Perforce.  

http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2git.html
http://repo.or.cz/w/fast-export.git
http://repo.or.cz/w/darcs2git.git

However, there's no reason Git should be the only VCS to read
git-fast-import files; there is a mature tool to read them into Bazaar
repositories.

http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrFastImport

If this tool can become an equally effective reader of such files for
Mercurial repositories, "git-fast-import" can become a "lingua franca"
for the exchange of repository histories between revision control
tools.

This tool draws heavily on the work done for BzrFastImport, and so is
covered by the GPL.
